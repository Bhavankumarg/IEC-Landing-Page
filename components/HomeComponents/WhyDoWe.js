        Why Do We Need An IEC?
      </h2>

        Catalyst Group Institutions along with our partners and other
        organisations working on social impact initiatives embark on a sizeable
        amount of research assignments which involves human subjects. The
        Catalyst Foundation, a Trust within the Catalyst Group, is strongly
        committed to promoting ethical practices in social impact initiatives.
        An Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) is vital to ensure that rigorous
        ethical standards of research are met. The IEC ensures that all research
        involving human subjects, especially vulnerable communities, adheres to
        ethical principles, safeguarding their dignity, safety, and rights
        throughout the process.
